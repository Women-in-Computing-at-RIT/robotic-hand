# robotic-hand
Robotic hand project. We followed [one of Microsoft's STEM lessons on building a robotic hand](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/education-workshop/robotic-hand.aspx) made out of common items and some electronics. Our materials are much of what is listed on that site. We made some adjustments following some issues we had with the project. The mian issue we had was the connections were quite finicky. Part of this is due to design, as this was meant to be a single lesson done in one sitting while we did this over a few weeks. We would do part of it then take it apart or have things get jostled between our weekly meetings. We also want this to be a more stable display piece that we can bring out for events. To help keep the connections more stable we replaced the solderless breadboard with a soldered breadboard. The wiring is the same it is just soldered connections instead of solderless plug ins. The other issue we had was with the sensors. We found the copper tape was not sending a good enough signal so we are replacing with Potentiometers, or knobs, that we can use to control the bending of the fingers.
